          <h3><b>MULSANNE</b></h3>
          <p><b>The Choice of the Visionary</b><br>
For those with a vision and the power to bring it to life, there is one car in the world that delivers both a space in which to make plans and the technology to help make them happen: the new Bentley Mulsanne.</p>

          <p><b>The Ultimate in Performance and Luxury</b><br>
The ultimate expression of performance and luxury, the new Bentley Mulsanne offers a remarkable choice: the new Mulsanne, the new Mulsanne Speed for more dynamic driving and, for the ultimate in chauffeur-driven comfort, the first ever Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase.</p>

          <p><b>Three Exquisite Interpretations</b><br>
The new Mulsanne is the quintessential expression of Bentley craftsmanship. The new Mulsanne Speed adds focus for those who enjoy the experience of driving their car and want to appreciate the full potential of the new Mulsanne’s power and torque. And for those who wish to be driven in unrivalled luxury and style, the Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase offers a rear-seat experience unlike any other on the road.</p>

          <p><b>Delectable Design</b><br>
With a completely re-designed front and rear for added road presence, new technology throughout the cabin and new lights, grilles and wing vents adorning the body, there has never been a better time to get acquainted with the world’s finest handmade car. More opulent, more comfortable and more technologically sophisticated than any Mulsanne before them, the three new models represent the pinnacle of automotive luxury.</p>

          <p><b>Uncompromising Vision</b><br>
The new Mulsanne represents a peerless combination of extraordinary luxury and effortless power; an exquisitely crafted environment in which drive time becomes time to think. So it is no surprise that the new Mulsanne appeals to free thinkers. Those for whom tomorrow arrives sooner than it does for the rest.</p>
          <h3><b>FLYING SPUR</b></h3>
          <p>The Bentley Flying Spur is a luxury sedan unlike any other – a Bentley for those that appreciate how the smallest things can make the biggest difference.</p>

          <p>Every detail is given unrivalled attention – inside, outside and under the bonnet. Enjoy the unparalleled luxury you expect from a Bentley, with the kind of startling acceleration, ride and handling previously unheard of in any luxury sedan. It’s all delivered in four distinctly different models – the Flying Spur V8, the dynamic Flying Spur V8 S, the exquisite Flying Spur and the powerful, striking new Flying Spur W12 S.</p>

          <p><b>A performance luxury sedan</b><br> 
Whichever model you select, you will be taking the wheel of a thrilling performance car that remains every inch a luxury sedan – one that takes more than 130 hours to build. Which is why you’ll be able to appreciate countless thoughtful differences in craftsmanship, engineering, design and technology.</p>

          <p>The 25 hours it takes to upholster the cabin by hand with contrast stitching are apparent every time you enter the car, as are the five layers of lacquer that are applied to the veneers before the finish meets the Bentley standard. The advanced Torsen all-wheel drive system, meanwhile, automatically manages the power distribution between the front and rear axles, instantaneously delivers most power to the wheels with the most traction on the road surface. With a 40:60 rear-biased torque split, it cuts understeer when powering through bends, for greater agility and increased driver confidence, even in challenging conditions.</p>

          <p>Above all, you will appreciate the innovative engineering that gives the Flying Spur such phenomenal acceleration, power and range.</p>

          <p><b>Designed to win hearts and minds</b></br>
On the street, the Flying Spur projects a contemporary, sporting look with crisp lines and a dynamic roofline that is eye-catching yet always retains the appropriate level of sophistication. Inside, the modern interiors are handcrafted with darker veneer choices for a contemporary look. All of these elements combine seamlessly to create a car that is far, far more than the sum of its many high quality parts. Which is what makes the Flying Spur the finest of luxury sedans.</p>


          <p><b>Introducing the Flying Spur W12 S</b><br>
With its 6.0-litre W12 engine, the Flying Spur has long occupied the top spot in this remarkable range of cars. But now, it is joined by a new model: for those drivers who appreciate even more power, precise handling and a certain sporting edge, Bentley has introduced the new Flying Spur W12 S.</p>

          <p>A sleeker silhouette, courtesy of a black gloss diffuser and other black exterior details, provides the onlooker with an inkling of the car’s sporting character. Inside, drilled alloy foot pedals, knurled stainless steel surfaces and unique black engine spin finishes on the fascia and door interiors provide a real sense of the car’s racing heritage. It’s a feeling that is confirmed on acceleration, when the ferocious power of the performance-tuned engine comes into its own.</p>

          <p><b>A design for life</b><br>
Every Flying Spur is built to deliver in every aspect of your life – whether you’re travelling for business in the city or you’re taking to the open road for a weekend away. The cabin is spacious and extremely comfortable, with technology that can keep everyone in the car occupied for the length of any journey. And the large boot means you can easily pack golf clubs and other large luggage – something generally unheard of in cars capable of such exhilarating performance.</p>

          <p><b>Never compromise</b><br>
Take a closer look at the Flying Spur and you will discover a car that is built without compromise. Immerse yourself in every curve, every hand-stitched leather seam, every painstakingly lacquered and polished wood veneer, every finely-milled millimetre of knurling. It’s the sum total of all these details that make every feature an experience to savour.</p>

          <p>Choose the Flying Spur and you will appreciate the difference with all of your senses.</p>
